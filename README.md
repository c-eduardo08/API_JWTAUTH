A simple API with FASTAPI and auth with JWT/Pydantic without database and really fast/simple

no requirements file yet.
required : 
 - python
 - fastapi ( 0.111.0) the latest
 - uvicorn
 - jwt ( 1.3.1) or the latest
 - pydantic



Next moves : 
  make a database and take of tokens more sec, encoded, not print 


Alerts : 
  some variables in the code it's wrong, like a email and password for sign up and sign in, this giving the token when u registr but not when u try to make it by the sign in, 
  This is happening because there are pre-defined variables and my lack of attention, so, feel free to correct this for yourself.
  I will be trying to update the code soon and make it more dynamic to requests



  * I found this code on a internet and try to remake this, sorry if is or not the same ( im making this for study )
  *  NONE DEPLOY
